**At Team EDI McGill, we are committed to fostering an inclusive, diverse, and equitable environment for graduate students in the Faculty of Engineering.** 

Our mission is to create a supportive academic community where students from all backgrounds feel valued, respected, and empowered. Through mentorship, advocacy, and community-building initiatives, we strive to break barriers and drive meaningful change in engineering education and research.

## EDI in Engineering Graduate Studies

The Faculty of Engineering is home to a diverse cohort of graduate students, each contributing unique perspectives to research and innovation. However, challenges such as underrepresentation, implicit bias, and accessibility gaps persist. Our goal is to **eliminate barriers to success** and promote inclusivity across all engineering disciplines.

:::note[Our Mission]
We focus on **three key pillars**:
- **Access & Representation:** Advocating for equitable opportunities for underrepresented students.
- **Support & Mentorship:** Facilitating peer support networks and faculty mentorship programs.
- **Inclusive Research & Teaching:** Encouraging ethical, unbiased, and diverse research practices in engineering.
